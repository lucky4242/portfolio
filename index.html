            <p>Hi, I’m Lucky</p>
            <p>
              I’m a software developer and technical author specializing in PHP,
              JavaScript, and database integrations. Based in Nigeria, I’ve been
              developing web applications and writing technical content for over
              five years.
            </p>

            <p>
              My focus is on simplifying complex technology. I build
              integrations with Laravel and Twilio, create self-service tools,
              and write clear, developer-focused content that helps others work
              more efficiently. My work covers multi-channel notifications,
              secure authentication flows, and practical, hands-on tutorials.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love solving problems with the knowledge I’ve gained while
              continually learning more aand I take pride in explaining
              solutions in a way that someone can put into action immediately.
